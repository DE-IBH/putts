putts - Probe Uptime by Tcp TimeStamps
======================================

putts sniffs for Tcp traffic of a remote host. If those Tcp packets contains
timestamps (RFC1323) this tool might be used to get the systems uptime.

This script calls tcpdump(8) to get the Tcp timestamps of the target host.
You have to make Tcp traffic to the remote host after starting putts. Terminate
putts by pressing C-C after a while. Putts will print the assumed uptime
if enough data is available.
